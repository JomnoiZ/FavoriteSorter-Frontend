# Favorite Sorter

This is my mini project for practicing the front end with the Svelte framework.
You can add your list of anything e.g. your favorite members or items. The website will provide you with two cards for comparing your list, you can select the one you prefer. After selecting, you can see your ranking result.

Warning! This website is created only on the front end. That is you have to sort your list at once time before closing the website!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
